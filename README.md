----------------
As a recent graduate at MacEwan University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I bring a strong technical foundation and a passion for innovation to the table. With hands-on experience in programming, database management, and more, I am well-equipped to begin tackling technical challenges.

But I am more than just a skilled coder. I am also a collaborative team player who values communication and feedback. I thrive in fast-paced environments from my experience in retail customer service and labouring work. In addition, my volunteer work with children and youth as a teenager at my local church created the team collaborator and active speaker that I am today. 

I am also committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry, and to expand my knowledge in technologies I am familiar with. I am always eager to learn and grow, and I am not afraid to take on new challenges.

As I begin my career, I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a team that shares my passion for innovation and excellence. I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to any organization that values technical expertise, collaboration, and continuous learning.
